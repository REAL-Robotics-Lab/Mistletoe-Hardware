### 3D Printing
3D printing orientations are in the `PRINTBEDS.3mf` file located in each mistletoe hardware release folder.  
You will need to print the items in the HIP and KNEE folder 4 times (4 legs), and the BODY folder 1 time. When there are more than one needed for that module, the stl will have the qty in front of the part name, ie. `2x  tensioner long`.

### Simulation
The simulation files are in the URDF or XACRO format, created using the [fusion2URDF fork by SpaceMaster85](https://github.com/SpaceMaster85/fusion2urdf). They can be run in rviz, or the simulation software of your choice. To use the URDF in Isaac Lab as we do, please reference the [Mistletoe-Sim](https://github.com/REAL-Robotics-Lab/Mistletoe-Sim.git) repository.
